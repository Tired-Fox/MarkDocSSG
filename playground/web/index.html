        <h1>An h1 header</h1>
        <p>Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
        </p>
        <p>2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
        look like:
        </p>
        <p>  * this one
          * that one
          * the other one
        </p>
        <p>Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
        content starts at 4-columns in.
        </p>
        <p>> Block quotes are
        > written like so.
        >
        > They can span multiple paragraphs,
        > if you like.
        >> nested blockquote
        >>> nested nested blockquote
        </p>
        <p>Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
        in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
        Unicode is supported. â˜º
        </p>
        <h2>An h2 header</h2>
        <p>Here's a numbered list:
        </p>
        <p> 1. first item
         2. second item
         3. third item
        </p>
        <p>Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
        from the left side). Here's a code sample:
        </p>
        <p>    # Let me re-iterate ...
            for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
        </p>
        <p>As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
        indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:
        </p>
        <p>~~~
        define foobar() {
            print "Welcome to flavor country!";
        }
        ~~~
        </p>
        <p>(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
        delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:
        </p>
        <p>~~~python
        import time
        # Quick, count to ten!
        for i in range(10):
            # (but not *too* quick)
            time.sleep(0.5)
            print i
        ~~~
        </p>
        <p>```rust
        fn hw() -> bool {
            println!("Hello World");
        }
        ```
        </p>
        <h3>An h3 header ###</h3>
        <p>Now a nested list:
        </p>
        <p> 1. First, get these ingredients:
        </p>
        <p>      * carrots
              * celery
              * lentils
        </p>
        <p> 2. Boil some water.
        </p>
        <p> 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
            this algorithm:
        </p>
        <p>        find wooden spoon
                uncover pot
                stir
                cover pot
                balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
                wait 10 minutes
                goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
        </p>
        <p>    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.
        </p>
        <p>Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
        that last line which continues item 3 above).
        </p>
        <p>Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
        doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
        doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].
        </p>
        <p>[^1]: Footnote text goes here.
        </p>
        <p>Tables can look like this:
        </p>
        <p>size  material      color
        ----  ------------  ------------
        9     leather       brown
        10    hemp canvas   natural
        11    glass         transparent
        </p>
        <p>Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of
        </p>
        <p>(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
        multi-line tables:
        </p>
        <p>--------  -----------------------
        keyword   text
        --------  -----------------------
        red       Sunsets, apples, and
                  other red or reddish
                  things.
        </p>
        <p>green     Leaves, grass, frogs
                  and other things it's
                  not easy being.
        --------  -----------------------
        </p>
        <p>A horizontal rule follows.
        </p>
        <p>***
        </p>
        <p>Here's a definition list:
        </p>
        <p>apples
          : Good for making applesauce.
        oranges
          : Citrus!
        tomatoes
          : There's no "e" in tomatoe.
        </p>
        <p>Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
        term/definition pair to spread things out more.)
        </p>
        <p>Here's a "line block":
        </p>
        <p>and images can be specified like so:
        </p>
        <p>![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")
        </p>
        <p>Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
        math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:
        </p>
        <p>$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$
        </p>
        <p>And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
        which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.</p>
