## Building your project

Building your project is as simple as running `mophidian build` from the root directory of all your other files. Given the user provided configurations, Mophidian will build all of the pages and static assets into the `site/` directory by default.

From here you just need to upload the contents of the `site/` directory to your preferred hosting service.
